## User-Story

As a developer I want a ReadME generator so that I can quickly create professional ReadMEs for any project.

## Description

Worked on creating a professional Readme.md Generator, using all Javscript. User will be able to enter a title, description, table of contents, installation, user story.
  
## Install

The user will need to "npm init" inside of the terminal, which will initialize the project. Then the user will need to run "npm I" which will install the dependencies located in the package.json file.
